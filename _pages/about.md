I am an Assistant Professional Professor of Computer Science at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. Previously, I was pursing my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My research interests focus on Machine Learning, NLP, and applying state-of-the-art AI techniques to analyze various modalities of data.
